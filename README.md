The OWASP Vulnerable Container Hub is a project that provides users with:
- access to docker/podman container image build files, including Dockerfile to build vulnerable containers
- documentation that describes each container, 
- and optionally, an link to the image in a repository, such as Docker Hub or Quay.io, where users can directly pull and run the container.

The files provided by the OWASP Vulnerable Container Hub allow users to build vulnerable container images, providing a platform for everyone to freely learn, play, practice, and perform quick proof-of-concepts of CVE vulnerabilities or use them for preparation for their CTF challenges.

The ultimate goal of the project is to enable anyone interested in security to share and maintain useful dockerfiles for security learning and practices. 

With the OWASP Vulnerable Container Hub, we strive to become the go-to reference for anyone seeking vulnerable containers.
